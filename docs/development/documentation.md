# Documentation

SUGAR Unity's documentation is generated using [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) using tripple slash code comments and DicFX .md and .toc files located in docs/.

## Building

There are various build scripts in docs/tools to build, copy and serve the docs.

### Requirements

- [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/)

- "docfx" as a command needs to be availabe via the command console for the scripts to work.

- PDF documentation requires [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/).

### Process
Run docs/tools/all_and_copy.bat to build all the docs, the pdf and copy them, into the relevant places.

OR 

Run docs/tools/metadata_build_and_serve.bat to serve and test the docs.

### PDF

The PDF was generated by following [this guide](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/walkthrough/walkthrough_generate_pdf.html).

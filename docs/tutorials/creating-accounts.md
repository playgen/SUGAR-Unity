# Creating a new SUGAR account
The [admin panel](https://admindemo.sugarengine.org/#!/login) is built for admins to manage their games, so does not allow for accounts to be created unless you are logged in already. Therefore, to get started, you must create a new account by either:
- Logging in to the [admin panel](https://admindemo.sugarengine.org/#!/) as an admin and creating new users at: Users > Create New User.
- Creating a new account using the [C# API](http://docs.sugarengine.org/api/PlayGen.SUGAR.Server.WebAPI.Controllers.AccountController.html#PlayGen_SUGAR_Server_WebAPI_Controllers_AccountController_Create_PlayGen_SUGAR_Contracts_AccountRequest_).

After creating a new SUGAR account, you will be able to sign in to both the admin panel and your game and see groups and games that are publicly available.
